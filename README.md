<h1 align="center"> Compiler to Hackâœ¨</h1>

<h2 align="left">
  Description:
</h2>

This project involves defining a grammar to specify a programming language's syntax and using it to generate corresponding Hack VM code, which can be executed on the Hack computer platform.

- This is a compiler for a defined grammar. 
- It has a Scanner (lexer) that reads the code and returns the tokens to the parser
- The parser defines if the code is valid. 
- The code generator creates the code that will run in a VMemulator

  Functionalities:
</h2>

- Defined grammar
- Basic arithmethic operations
- Loops (repeat 'code' until 'condition to stop')
- Conditonal (if, else)
- Logic operators (greater, great equal, less, less equal)
